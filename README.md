Javascript exercises found on http://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/
These are my attempts at solving the exercises found at the above. When I get stumped, I go out and learn what I need to in order to solve the exercise. These are not the only or best solutions - they are just my solutions. In some cases, I may not have tested all possible scenarios. If you see something that could be better, feel free to do a pull request. The overall goal of this repo is to learn by doing. I've read a ton of information, but I want to get as much practice as I can to go along with that reading.
